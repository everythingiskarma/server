        Sustainability has to be a guiding principle that must unify our goals in an intricate way to develop a more cohesive and truly responsive world.

        It starts with building an interdependent framework of educational, technological, political, social and economic faculties designed to help solve the environmental challenges. We can call it the sustainability forum. To look at resolving a problem like a dry cleaning company leaking fabric dye with potentially hazardous chemical composition into the river across the road brings everything into perspective.

        The knowledge it would need to recycle the waste water before it is released into nature. The machinery and tools that would play their part in eliminating the hazard before the water hits the drainage. The policies and the administrative finesse that shall ensure the enforcement of in house waste water treatment. A collective social awareness and activism that would resound so loud that it would become impossible to ignore the issue at hand. And finally the execution rests on the all mighty shoulders of the entities who will fund this rescue.

        Now to think about resolution for this particular situation as an independent establishment does not address the entire problem. My lightbulbs lit up the moment I witnessed the atrocity first hand. I could not help but take pictures and a few short videos. It dawned on me that being conscious and responsible can not be left to choice. There is a need for a platform where all of these participants can be brought together, not just here and now but wherever the situation demands in any part of the world.

        There are certainly quite a few high level communities advocating urgency for drastic measures. But the problem is on the ground, and very far from the offices of the UN or the Gatesâ€™ Foundation. People who have succeeded in connecting the nations and connecting the people are a great example. It makes me believe that when the same cohesion will manifest, resolving this problem will be a matter of just another day at work!
