        It is an established fact that natureâ€™s design is self-sustaining and highly efficient. Learning from that and optimizing practices in harmony with it are defining steps towards developing a healthy ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially a balanced cycle of resource consumption and energy exchanges between animate and inanimate elements is what makes up an ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is paramount to be aware of the effect of your collective actions on the environment. To have zero negative impact would be an ideal plan, however it would be naive to even make such a proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every physical action uses energy and energy must be transferred from source to its recipient to perform the action, which invariably disturbs the balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, burning wood to cook food, or taking a cab to the supermarket, or printing your resume on a piece of paper. Everything we do, even as I'm writing this article and as you are reading it, is constantly consuming resources. Resources that are not necessarily always renewable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key is to be informed and be responsible. Adopt renewable energy. Avoid the use of fossil fuels by transitioning to green energy sources and building and using machines and mechanisms that harness it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the knowledge of the urgency of the matter travels across to the collective consciousness of the world, there is work to be done today so that we can ensure sustainability for tomorrow.
