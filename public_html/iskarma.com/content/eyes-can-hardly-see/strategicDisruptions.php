        Technology drives the economy of the entire world! Our whole ecosystem is built with technology at its core. It is hard to imagine a day in your life without it. Communication, electricity, transportation, manufacturing and almost every activity we indulge in, directly or indirectly depends on or is affected by it.

        As much as it is a strength of any system, it is also its most critical weakness. Especially in the case of computers that are becoming increasingly advanced and penetrating deeper into every aspect of technology. If you can control them you can move mountains. It has the power to bring nations to their knees.

        The balance of power is slowly shifting towards an unrivalled supremacy. There is always going to be an odd challenger making ruckus and even posing a reasonable threat to the regime. But the odds are stacked heavily against them. It would be futile or even suicidal to attempt traditional rebellion.

        The only strategy that stands a fighting chance is, if it happens from within. It means infiltrating the body of leadership and maintaining an influence that would silently prevent total disparity.

        But this is all already happening! There are backdoors into everything and resistance from behind the shadows. There have been odd whistleblowers and anonymous leaks of top secret information in an attempt to disrupt the prejudice and expose the state of affairs. But these have merely been surface scratches and opportunities to learn from.

  This post talks about the fight we have inherited from the keepers of freedom and justice. We are centuries into human existence and yet we still fight each other, all to the benefit of the puppet masters.
