        Liberty is a relic of the time long gone. The future is architectured to very subtly, embed your consent allowing the eye a free pass into your private life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Internet for example is like a digital ocean of information about everyone. Social media is a public platform where we have already willingly exposed our lives. We're doing most of the work for them. Trusting the service providers with our personal and business information, we are already vulnerable. The more we build our dependency on them, more power they possess over us.
      </p>

      <p>
        What they can or will do with that power, is something I don't want to be a judge of at the moment. I'll leave it to your imagination. All they need, is an excuse! National security agencies have a forcing hand that will tap open any door they find necessary. It's better to be safe than sorry, correct?
      </p>

      <p>
        And these are just the "good guys" who we trust with the security of our lives. But when it comes to war, everything is fair, and we're all sitting ducks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The future of internet and privacy has been orchestrated by the pioneers to transpire into an "open" society with no real ethics. On the surface they present a noble face but we all know that there is no way to know what goes on behind the scenes. Unless ofcourse, we ourselves become the invaders and keep a tab on everything. And hence lose the battle, before it even begins!
      </p>

      <p>
        Now the question is, should we then, abandon the internet and the digital world and return to living in caves?
      </p>

      <p>
        This leads us to an alternative realm of existence, the underground! Generally feared and frowned upon by the media controlled by the eye, the underground is the resistance. My idea of the underground and what it represents is a story for another day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Time will come, machines will rise and rule the world and few amongst us will still be bearing the beacon of hope. We will find a way!

  An alarmist dig at the fate of internet security and privacy, where the laws laid down by its operators reign supreme and how the world has no real choice but to accept and confirm to it.
