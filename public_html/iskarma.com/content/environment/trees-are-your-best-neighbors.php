        Keeping the science behind it and its validation for some other day, the pressing fact is, we need about 8 trees per person to provide the oxygen we require for breathing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trees are the lungs of our atmosphere with the magical ability to produce oxygen, when exposed to light through a chemical reaction called photosynthesis. It uses water and carbon dioxide to make glucose, releasing oxygen as by-product.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in absence of light, trees breathe just like us. They consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide, but the net oxygen produced in the daytime is believed to be ten times higher than what is used during the night.

        Urbanization, pollution and deforestation are causing a catastrophic imbalance in the composition of the earth's atmospheric content. Global warming as a result is a ticking bomb that is conniving perilous disasters and must be met with immediate and decisive counter measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Balance must be restored. Individuals, businesses and industries must all be held accountable for their share of damage to the air and authorities must be educated about ways to achieve a carbon neutral business ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rudimentary action plan that businesses can self initiate would be to calculate their carbon footprint and offset it by planting trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a deeper level, as an affirmative action, with professional help, adopt machinery and mechanisms that reduce energy and resource consumption to cause lesser or better still, no pollution.
