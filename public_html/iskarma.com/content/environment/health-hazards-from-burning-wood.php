        I would like to go back in time and recall the issue of air pollution I used to face near my residence. There was a settlement of daily wage workers residing under the metro flyover opposite my house.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were more than 15 families including women and children that used the place to rest at night, while they were away for work or seeking work during the daytime. The lack of proper housing for the underprivileged left them at the mercy of nature.

        Without the utilities they had to resort to using wood as fuel to light a fire for cooking, staying warm and other daily needs. This used to happen twice a day between 5am - 7am in the morning and 6pm - 8pm in the evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        It caused a massive cloud of smoke in and around my house. The air was so densely clogged with potentially harmful and carcinogenic gases that the effect lasted up to 10am to 11am in the morning and 10pm to 12am in the night time.
      </p>

        This was almost a 12 hour window that I was living under the danger of breathing in harmful chemicals. Facing discomfort in breathing and health and safety of my family became a serious concern.
      </p>

        Fast forward to now, and I am yet again grinding my teeth as I am placed a couple of hops across a woodworking workshop. No denying that the weather here isnâ€™t kind, but the hazard from breathing smoke far outweighs the struggle against the winter cold.
