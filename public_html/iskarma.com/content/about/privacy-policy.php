    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        IsKarma ["us", "we" or "our"] operates the https://wwww.iskarma.com website (the "Service") along with the associated mobile applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
      </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        Security and privacy of your personal information and data is embedded in our company's DNA as the foremost principle. Every precaution is taken and all known measures are employed to ensure that we do not intentionally or unintentionally cause any damage or distress resulting from our use of the information you choose to share with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not have an enforcing policy (i.e cookie policy), where in, we restrict or obstruct your experience during the use of our Service, unless you agree and accept the terms. Instead, we take it upon us to refrain from engaging into activities that might require exposing your data to third-party service providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This essentially means that we refuse to deploy or encourage the use of third party tools like 'online activity trackers' and 'user analytics' in our code. Not even under the guise of personalizing and improving your user experience. We stop the intrusion at the gate. Any information we do collect is encrypted using most efficient algorithms known to us and stored securely on our servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having mentioned that, it would be naive to believe that we are impenetrable. We too are learning and constantly evolving our systems to adopt best security practices for ethical use of collected data. If you have any suggestions to improve the way we handle your information, feel free to drop us a mail at iskarma@proton.me
